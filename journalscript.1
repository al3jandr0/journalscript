.SH NAME
.PP
journalscript - an interactive command line journaling tool
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
journalscript
.PP
journalscript \f[V]COMMAND [ARG...]\f[R]
.PP
journalscript \f[V][--help|-v|--verions]\f[R]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Journalscript is an interactive journaling tool for the command line.
.PP
It allows users to manage multiple journals, and it organizes them in
directories.
Each directory corresponds to a journal.
Journal entries are stored in journal directories, and each entry is
name as the current date (i.e.\ \f[V]2023-02-14.txt\f[R])
.PP
Journalscript is highly configurable.
However it requires no configuration upfront; its default behavior is
sufficient and functional.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\f[V]-v\f[R], \f[V]--version\f[R]\ 
Prints version information and quits.
.TP
\f[V]--help\f[R]\ 
Prints usage statement and quits.
.SH COMMANDS
.SS write [journal]
.PP
Creates and opens a new journal entry for the current date (YYY-mm-dd).
If such entry exists already, it opens the existing entry.
For new files, it creates a new file using a template.
To open a journal entry the command makes use of an open hook, and if
none exists then it uses the configured editor.
After the user closes such editor, then journalscript invokes a backup
hook if any exists.
The default journal is called `life', and when no journal directory
exist, it prompts the user to create a new one.
Write is the default command, so when journalscript is invoked without a
command, journalscript runs the write command without arguments.
.PP
\f[B]TEMPLATES\f[R]
.PP
Journalscript looks for templates in the following locations:
.IP "1." 3
A template specific to the editor.
Any template file under \f[V]/templates/tempate.d/\f[R] with name
matching the editor
.IP "2." 3
The default template \f[V]/templates/template\f[R]
.PP
In case no other template is found, the fall back behavior is to write
the the current date on the first line of the journal entry.
.PP
\f[B]HOOKS\f[R]
.PP
Journalscript leverages hooks to allow users to customize editing and
backing up journal entries.
By default, journalscript opens a journal entry using the configured
editor, and it takes no action to backup entries.
However, by configuring an \f[B]open hook\f[R] the user can customize
both the editor and the arguments passed to the editor., and by
configuring a \f[B]backup hook\f[R] the user tells to run a backup
routine upon exiting the editor.
.PP
Journalscript looks for an open hook in the following locations:\ 
.IP "1." 3
A hook specific to the configured editor.
Any file under \f[V]/hooks/open.d/\f[R]\ 
.IP "2." 3
The default hook \f[V]/hooks/open\f[R]
.PP
Journalscript looks for backup hook in the following locations:\ 
.IP "1." 3
A hook specific to the configured editor.
Any file under \f[V]/hooks/backup.d/\f[R]\ 
.IP "2." 3
The default hook \f[V]/hooks/backup\f[R]
.SS configure [show|init]
.PP
Assists with the configuration of journalscript.
When configure is invoked with no arguments it defaults to show.
.PP
\f[B]show\f[R]\ 
.PP
Displays the configuration parameters (also referred as environment
variables) along with its assigned values, and quits.
.PP
\f[B]init\f[R]\ 
.PP
Launches an interactive wizard that helps the user setting up a
journalscript configuration
