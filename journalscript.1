.SH NAME
.PP
journalscript - an interactive command line journaling tool.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
journalscript
.PP
journalscript \f[V]COMMAND [ARG...]\f[R]
.PP
journalscript \f[V][--help|-v|--verions]\f[R]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Journalscript is an interactive journaling tool for the command line.
.PP
It allows users to manage multiple journals, and it organizes them in
directories.
Each directory corresponds to a journal.
Journal entries are stored in journal directories, and each entry is
name as the current date (i.e.\ \f[V]2023-02-14.txt\f[R]).
.PP
Journalscript is highly configurable.
However it requires no configuration upfront; its default behavior is
sufficient and functional.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\f[V]-v\f[R], \f[V]--version\f[R]\[rs]
Prints version information and quits.
.TP
\f[V]--help\f[R]\[rs]
Prints usage statement and quits.
.SH COMMANDS
.SS write [journal]
.PP
Writes a new entry to the journal.
If no journal is provided, it writes to the default journal.
Journals are stored as directories and each journal entry is a file in
the journal directory.
Each journal entry corresponds to a day, and their name is formated:
YYYY-mm-dd.
.PP
The command creates new files if they don\[cq]t exists, and it copies a
template into them if template is configured.
Then it launches the configured editor to open the new journal entry (or
an existing one).
Once the user closes the editor, journalscript invokes a backup hook if
any exists.
.SS configure [show|init]
.PP
Assists with the configuration of journalscript.
When configure is invoked with no arguments it defaults to show.
.PP
\f[B]show\f[R]
.PD 0

.SH FILES
.SS Configuration
.PP
Journalscript behavior is customizable with via environment variables
(see ENVIRONMENT).
Additionally, journalscript supports loading variables from a file named
\f[V]journalscript.env\f[R].
So user can either modify the environment or write a
\f[V]journalscript.env\f[R] in order to customize journalscript.
Journalscript looks for \f[V]journalscript.env\f[R] in two locations:
first in \f[V]\[ti]/.config/journalscript/\f[R], then in
\f[V]\[ti]/.journalscript/\f[R], and it only loads variables declared in
the file that are not in the environment.
That is, variables in the environment are not overridden.
.PP
Note: journalscript is not limited to loading journalscript-specific
variables declared in file; any variable in journalscript.env will be
declared.
This makes journalscript.env a suitable place to declare additional
variables used by hooks.
.SS Hooks
.PP
Hooks are bash scripts that Journalscript runs in order to sync and
backup journal entries, and they allow users to customize these two
actions.
There are two types of hooks: sync and backup.
.PP
Sync hook scripts, as the name suggests, synchronizes journal entries
with an externally backedup version of the journal.
It is invoked before editing a journal.
.PP
Backup hook scripts are routines to back up journal entries.
A backup hook is runs after an open hook and once the user closes the
editor.
The default behavior is to do nothing.
